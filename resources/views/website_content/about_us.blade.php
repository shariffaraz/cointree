                    Cointree Network is a global distribution network to help people from all over the world accumulate digital assets and participate in blockchain technology. By combining a crowd funded mining pool with the power of an affiliate structure we have an opportunity for members to leverage their earning potential unlike anything else in this space.<br><br>In 3 years we have mined over 50,000 Bitcoin and 250,000 Ethereum and all of these coins (100% of them) have been shared back to the members of Cointree Network.<br>

                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    First you purchase mining equipment (actual computer servers) that are used to mine Bitcoin or other Digital Currencies. This pays you daily on whatever is mined

Second you share your affiliate URL and sign up other members. When they purchase mining equipment you get paid a commission on everything they buy. 

The more you share, the more you can earn. It's that simple!

                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">
                    Bitcoin is a new asset that uses a distributed public ledger to send the token from one person to another. This all happens without a central bank or third party and it's not controlled by any individual company, or person. 

All transactions are completely transparent and thousands of copies of the ledger are kept across a distributed network of computers with no single point of failure or possible manipulation. In other words, Bitcoin is a true decentralized asset that can move freely around the world and nobody can control it.<br>With Bitcoin you are given a public key and a private key. Your public key is your address that everyone knows (sort of like an email address or bank account number). Then your private key is what allows you to unlock your public key and send Bitcoins from one account to another. This acts like your password but it's much more secure.

On the downside if you lose your private key there is no way to recover it so no matter which wallet you store Bitcoin in, make sure you back it up and keep your private keys safe.

t<br>Bitcoin was the first and it's the most valuable blockchain asset. However, there are many blockchain assets available today and we believe there will be dozens if not hundreds of valuable blockchain tokens/assets that emerge in the future. This is why we decided to expand into Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, DASH, Monero, and Zcash mining. 

These coins are now available through our NEW GPU Mining Pool that you can purchase as a member. Each GPU machine is capable of mining dozens of coins and we will continue to add more options as they become worth it. Each share in this pool will mine for 2,000 days and yo have full control over which coins to mine. 

We also have our own token we developed called ClubCoin which you can learn more about here.

The future of Blockchain technology has arrived and with Cointree Network you have the opportunity to accumulate these digital assets through daily mining.<br>
